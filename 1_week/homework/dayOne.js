//1. Declare variables called ‘country’ and ‘continent’ and assign their values according to your own home country.

const country = 'Colombia';
const continent = 'America'

//2. Log their values to the console

console.log(country)
console.log(continent)

//3. Create a variable with let or const and assign its value to a string. Have fun! Make it one of your favorite things, whether’s that’s a car, a pet, a family member, a food, etc.

let favoriteAnimal = 'panda'
let favoriteMusic = 'techno'

//4. Should “15” === 15 return “true” or “false”? Console.log your answer.

console.log("15" === 15) //returns false since de datatype is not the sanme
