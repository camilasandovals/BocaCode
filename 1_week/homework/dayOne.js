//1. Declare variables called ‘country’ and ‘continent’ and assign their values according to your own home country.
const country = 'Colombia'; // The 'country' variable is declared and assigned a value of 'Colombia'.
const continent = 'America'; // The 'continent' variable is declared and assigned a value of 'America'.

//2. Log their values to the console
console.log(country); // The value of the 'country' variable is logged to the console.
console.log(continent); // The value of the 'continent' variable is logged to the console.

//3. Create a variable with let or const and assign its value to a string. Have fun! Make it one of your favorite things, whether’s that’s a car, a pet, a family member, a food, etc.
let favoriteAnimal = 'panda'; // The 'favoriteAnimal' variable is declared using the 'let' keyword and assigned a value of 'panda'.
let favoriteMusic = 'techno'; // The 'favoriteMusic' variable is declared using the 'let' keyword and assigned a value of 'techno'.

//4. Should “15” === 15 return “true” or “false”? Console.log your answer.
console.log("15" === 15); // The result of the expression "15" === 15 is logged to the console. It returns false since the data types are not the same.
